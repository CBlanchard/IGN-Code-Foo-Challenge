Imagine, if you will, the greatest mind of our time.  Now imagine a mind even greater, with even more to bring to the table than anyone on the planet.  Pretty cool guy, right?  Yeah, I'd like to meet him too.  If you find him let me know.

My name is Chris Blanchard, and I'm not the greatest mind ever (if you haven't figured that out already).  I live in Chesapeake, VA, and have lived in this general area for most of my life.  I even went to college around here.  I started college two days after my high school graduation.  I spent 4 years at ITT Tech, earning a BS in Digital Entertainment & Game Design.  While going to school, I got leadership experience by managing the Pizza Hut around the corner from my house.  When I was told they were letting me go due to a policy change (I did not have a liscense at the time, and the new policy required all managers to have a liscense and a car), I found a new job at Liberty Tax Service's corporate office as a tier one tech support representative.  While there I have coded several items, mainly batch files, to help improve the speed of resolutions on the floor.  I have now come back to Liberty Tax Service for three tax seasons (it is a seasonal position).  My third season I was promoted to a tier two tech support coach, and was able to achieve my A+ certification.

So while I may not be the greatest mind ever, I have a lot to bring to the table.  I have leadership skills, game design knowledge, and even some coding experience from my time at tech support.
